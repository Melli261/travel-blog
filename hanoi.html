                <h2>Welcome to Hanoi, Vietnam</h2>
                <div class="decorative-line-title"></div>
                <p>
                    Hanoi, the bustling capital of Vietnam, is a city full of contrasts. From its vibrant Old Quarter with winding streets and ancient temples to its serene lakes and French-colonial architecture, 
                    Hanoi is a perfect blend of old and new. It was my choice over Saigon because I wanted to experience the heart of traditional Vietnam. While Saigon is known for its modern, fast-paced energy, 
                    Hanoi offers a more intimate glimpse into the country’s rich cultural heritage.
                    <br>Unlike the bustling metropolis of Saigon, Hanoi presents a slower, more reflective side of Vietnam. The French-colonial architecture is not just a reminder of history, but a part of daily life, 
                    harmoniously blending with modern elements. I wanted to immerse myself in this timeless beauty — to explore the delicate balance between the old traditions and the evolving future that Hanoi so effortlessly embodies.

                <h2>Top Attractions in Hanoi</h2>
                <div class="decorative-line-title"></div>
                <p>
                    Hanoi is home to many must-see attractions that showcase both its rich history and vibrant culture. Start your journey at Hoan Kiem Lake, the beating heart of the city. 
                    Surrounded by shaded walking paths and centuries-old trees, it offers a peaceful retreat from the bustling streets. 
                    Here, you can visit the Ngoc Son Temple, a small but significant shrine that sits on a tiny island in the middle of the lake. 
                    This serene spot, rich in history and local legend, is perfect for moments of quiet reflection or simply enjoying the beauty of Hanoi’s natural and architectural wonders.
                    <br>If you’re craving a deeper cultural experience, make sure to visit the Temple of Literature, Vietnam’s first national university. 
                    This centuries-old temple is dedicated to Confucius and remains a symbol of Vietnam’s long-standing reverence for education and learning. 
                    Walking through its peaceful courtyards, I couldn’t help but feel connected to the generations of scholars who once studied here.
                    <br>Between sightseeing, I often found myself in one of the many cozy cafés nestled within the maze of narrow alleys, where I could unwind and catch up on my studies. 
                    These cafés, many of which offer rooftop views of the city or quiet corners for reflection, were the perfect place to dive into my university work while soaking in the energy of Hanoi.

                <h2>My Recommendations</h2>
                <div class="decorative-line-title"></div>
                <p>
                    For the best experience in Hanoi, I highly recommend trying the local cuisine. Start with Pho, the famous Vietnamese noodle soup, from a street vendor — it’s a must. 
                    If you enjoy coffee, make sure to try both the unique Egg Coffee and the refreshing Coconut Coffee. Personally, I found the Coconut Coffee to be even better!
                    <br>A boat tour to Halong Bay is an absolute must. I did a day trip, which was amazing, but if you have the time, I highly suggest an overnight tour to fully enjoy the beautiful sunrise and sunset over the bay. 
                    And if you want to explore further, take a trip to Cat Ba Island. I found it best to organize the transfer myself, which was cheaper. I’ve linked the spot where I booked my transfer to Cat Ba. 
                    Once there, I stayed in a hostel and explored the island on my own — a great way to experience its natural beauty.
